Guidelines
==========

* included is ruby program called "diamond.rb". Make a copy of said file and rename it to [your name here]_diamond.rb.

  For example,
```ruby
  	ulysses_diamond.rb

```

* open up the ruby program you just copy and under line 1, replace the following code

```ruby
	require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/diamond.rb"
```
  
  with something like this
  
```ruby 
  	require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/[your name here]_diamond.rb"	
```
  	
  For example
  
```ruby  
  	require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/ulysses_diamond.rb"		
```  	
 
 * place the code that you going to write into the **main** method. 

 * after cloning the repo, from **develop** branch, create a new branch and give it a name of your 
  first name. For example, given that I am currently in the **develop** branch and I create a new
  branch called **ulysses**, when I do a git branch command from the terminal, I should see a list 
  of git branches and one of them is named **ulysses**.
